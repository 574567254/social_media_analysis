# social_media_analysis

In this project, we will first use training data on social influence to build a model to predict influencers, and to find out the important predictors of influence, and to quantify the financial value of influence. We will use different machine learning algorithms to choose the one that yields the highest accuracy score.

And then we will collect about 5,000 tweets about Tesla, and use the predictors from previous steps to identify top 100 influencers

### See Social Media Analysis Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis
